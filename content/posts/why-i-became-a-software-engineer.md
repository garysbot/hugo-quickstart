I became a software engineer because marketing sucks.

I've considered myself a marketer since 2008 when I started my first business.

To market the brand, I became a graffiti artist canvasing the streets of New York City in paint and wheatpaste.

When I graduated with a degree in Marketing & Entrepreneurship from Babson College, I joined a startup entering Techstars Boston called Indico.

One of the co-founders was Alec Radford, one of the original authors of the GPT paper, the foundational academeia around deploying generative large language models.

He was head of research and it was brilliant.
